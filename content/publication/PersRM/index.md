summary: We propose PersRM-R1, a reasoning-based reward model that learns personal preferences from just a few examples. Using synthetic data and a two-stage training pipeline, it achieves high accuracy and generalization, outperforming models of similar size and rivaling much larger onesâ€”paving the way for more personalized LLMs.
