summary: We propose the Intrinsic Sound Curiosity Module (ISCM) to use sound as an informative modality for unsupervised reinforcement learning. In realistic manipulation scenarios with simulated audio, ISCM guides exploration and representation learning. Experiments show that sound-driven pre-training leads to better representations and faster adaptation than vision-only baselines.
