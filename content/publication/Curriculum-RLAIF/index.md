summary: We propose Curriculum-RLAIF, a data-centric framework that improves reward model generalizability by training on preference pairs of increasing difficulty. This curriculum-based approach addresses data noise, distribution shift, and model-capacity mismatch. Experiments show that Curriculum-RLAIF significantly boosts policy alignment performance without extra inference cost, outperforming non-curriculum and alternative strategies.
