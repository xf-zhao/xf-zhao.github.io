summary: We propose an LLM-driven framework that enables **robots to autonomously discover useful skills from scratch**. By generating tasks, rewards, and success criteria, the LLM guides reinforcement learning, while a vision-language model verifies outcomes. This allows the robot to build a meaningful skill library without relying on predefined primitives.
