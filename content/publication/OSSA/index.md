summary: "We introduce OSSA (Object State-Sensitive Agent), a task-planning agent using pre-trained LLMs and VLMs to generate plans sensitive to object states. We compare two methods: a modular approach combining vision and language models, and a monolithic VLM approach. Evaluated on tabletop tasks involving clearing a table, OSSAâ€™s monolithic model outperforms the modular one. A new multimodal benchmark dataset with object state annotations is provided."
