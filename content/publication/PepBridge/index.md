summary: PepBridge jointly designs receptor-complementary protein surfaces and full 3D structures from a receptor’s point-cloud surface. It uses denoising diffusion bridges to generate ligand surfaces, a diffusion model to build backbone/side chains, and Shape-Frame Matching to align geometry for stability and chemical realism. Validated across diverse tasks, PepBridge produces diverse, physically plausible proteins.
