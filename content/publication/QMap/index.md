summary: Explainable Q-Map improves the transparency of RL agents by combining reward decomposition with abstract action spaces, enabling clear, high-level explanations based on task-relevant object properties. We demonstrate visual and textual explanations in robotic scenarios and show how they can be used with LLMs for reasoning and interactive querying.
