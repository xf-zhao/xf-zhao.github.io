summary: We present Matcha agent, an interactive perception framework that uses LLMs to guide robots in gathering multimodal sensory data (vision, sound, haptics, proprioception) before executing tasks. Matcha enables high-level reasoning and planning in partially observable environments, showing that LLMs can effectively control robot behavior when grounded with multimodal context.
