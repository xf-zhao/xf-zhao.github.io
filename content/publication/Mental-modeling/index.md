summary: This study explores whether LLMs can mentally model decision-making agents by reasoning over their behavior and state transitions from interaction histories. Evaluated on reinforcement learning tasks, results show that while LLMs offer some insight, they fall short of fully modeling agents without further innovation, highlighting both their potential and current limitations for explainable RL.
