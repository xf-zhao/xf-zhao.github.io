summary: We propose REAL (Response Embedding-based Alignment for LLMs), a method to improve alignment efficiency by selecting less ambiguous, dissimilar response pairs for annotation. By leveraging embedding similarity in an off-policy manner, REAL reduces label noise and improves alignment quality. Experiments show it boosts performance while cutting annotation effort by up to 65%.
