*It was an honor to attend the [40th Anniversary of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA@40)](https://icra40.ieee.org/), where I had the chance to meet so many talented pioneers from the robotics community and beyond. The event was exceptionally well-organized, and I truly appreciate the experience!*


I often joke that my most motivated (and sometimes most productive ðŸ¤£) moments happen during conferences. It's not just the influx of fresh ideas and inspiring discussions, but also the collective energy and my own desire to contribute to the field, just like so many talented individuals do.

- Gaining an overview of the field, from current SOTAs to open questions
- Engaging in engineering, exploration, and deep dives into areas that have the potential to make a real difference
