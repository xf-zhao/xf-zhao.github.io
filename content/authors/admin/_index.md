üëã Hi! I I defended my PhD on 08.10.2025‚ÄºÔ∏è 
Committee: [Prof. Stefan Wermter](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/wtm/people/wermter.html) (supervisor), [Prof. Jianwei Zhang](https://tams.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/people/zhang/) (deputy), and [Prof. S√∂ren Laue](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/ml/people/laue.html) (chair). 

I study embodied agents that explore, learn, and adapt autonomously, unifying reinforcement learning, world modeling, and large language models so agents can reason, acquire skills, and scale with minimal supervision.
My long-term goal is to deliver robust, trustworthy systems that assist people in complex real-world settings.
