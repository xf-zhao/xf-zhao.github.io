ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a PhD candidate supervised by [Prof. Stefan Wermter](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/wtm/people/wermter.html). My research focuses on intelligent embodied agents that explore and adapt autonomously through interaction with the environment. Iâ€™m particularly interested in combining reinforcement learning, world modeling, and large language models to enable agents to reason, acquire skills, and scale their capabilities with minimal supervision. My long-term goal is to build reliable and generalizable systems that can assist and collaborate with humans in complex real-world settings.
